VERSE ONE

 Staring at the stars I feel so spent
 I've been crying up all night I've drenched my bed
 Open up your eyes and see my tears
 I've been tryna show you just how much I care
 Even if I wrote a hundred songs
 It'll never be enough to end your hurt
 Oh my I just wish for a time machine
 So that I may try to be a better me

CHORUS
 My lover lover My lover lover
 No no no My lover lover
 Wanna be with you until the end
 My lover lover You're my lover lover
 No no no My lover lover
 Forever you'll always be my dear

HOOK
 I wanna go back to the times We were in our prime
 Before I broke your trust with lies
 And you were totally mine
 I wanna go back to the days We were not in a maze
 When my smile will light up your face
 And I had the time to change

VERSE TWO

 Never did I thought we'll get to part
 I can't sleep because I know I broke your heart
 Thoughts of being wrapped within your arms
 Are becoming things I wouldn't even dare
 I'm sorry for the hurtful words I said
 You were always trying to show me that you cared
 I'm sorry I was never there for you
 You were pure in heart but I was just a fool

CHORUS

 My lover lover My lover lover
 No no no My lover lover
 Wanna be with you until the end
 My lover lover You're my lover lover
 No no no My lover lover
 Forever you'll always be my dear

HOOK

I wanna go back to the times We were in our prime
 Before I broke your trust with lies
 And you were totally mine
 I wanna go back to the days We were not in a maze
 When my smile will light up your face
 And I had the time to change

BRIDGE

 Do you know?
 Memories we shared, Have been stuck inside my head
 Stuck inside my head, Have been stuck inside my head!
 Oh I hope
 For just a second chance and I'd love you till the end
 Love you till the end, Yeah I'd love you till the end

CHORUS

 My lover lover My lover lover
 No no no My lover lover
 Wanna be with you until the end
 My lover lover You're my lover lover
 No no no My lover lover
 Forever you'll always be my dear
 Do you know?
 Memories we shared, Have been stuck inside my head
 Stuck inside my head, Have been stuck inside my head!
 Oh I hope
 For just a second chance and I'd love you till the end
 Love you till the end, Yeah I'd love you till the end
