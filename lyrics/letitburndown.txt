VERSE ONE

Back in time when I was young
And had no fear, yeah I was strong
But then some people came along
And tore me down with all they got
But somehow I escaped their grip
As a broken man with shattered dreams
Who's yearning for a time he'll be
So free and maybe too fulfilled
Yeah I know it's prolly time
For my dreams to come alive
I've been working hard to make sure that they never get to die
For so long I feel confined
But right now it's time to shine
Coz I'm ready and I'm loaded
Time to fly and say goodbye

PRE CHORUS

Now as you count down
To the time when I ride on finesse
To the time when I pass all the test
To the time when all I do is blessed
let it Burn...

CHORUS

Let it burn down
All the doubts you've, always had of me
And All the lies you, always had believed
And All the hate you always had conceal
Let it Burn....

VERSE TWO

Welcome to a whole new me
Who's done with all the misery
No longer begging just to breathe
I found the strength to just believe
I don't need to prove I'm real
My presence is the proof you feel
No longer quiet, now I speak
There's nothing you can do to me
At this moment I become
Something you just can't outrun
There's no escapade I'm here to burn
All doubt and lie you formed
Don't act blind or prolly dumb
Yeah it's high time you succumb
The more you watch the more you're stunned
Till you just can't take it no more

PRE CHORUS

Now as you count down
To the time when I ride on finesse
To the time when I pass all the test
To the time when all I do is blessed
let it Burn...

CHORUS

Let it burn down
All the doubts you've, always had of me
And All the lies you, always had believed
And all the hate you always had conceal
Let it Burn....

HOOK

Let it burn down
Every single negative thought
I'm still the one now
Ready to show what was in store

CHORUS

Now as you count down
To the time when I ride on finesse [On Finesse]
To the time when I pass all the test [All the Tests]
To the time when all I do is blessed
Yeah Let it Burn...
Let it burn down
All the doubts you've, always had of me [Had of me]
And All the lies you, always had believed [Had believed]
And all the hate you always had conceal
Yeah Let it Burn..
